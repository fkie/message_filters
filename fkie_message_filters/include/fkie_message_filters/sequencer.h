 * the expected maximum delay by which messages might arrive out of order, and forwarded messages will be out of date
 * by at least this delay. However, all forwarded messages will be guaranteed to be in temporal order, and no message
 * will be dropped unless it arrives with a larger delay, compared to the most recently received message.
 *
 * The filter supports multiple inputs, but will only consider the first input to sort messages.
