The fkie_message_filters library is a replacement for the ROS message_filters package. It is written in modern
C++ and more type-safe than the original version.

\par

The data flow is modeled with a pipeline metaphor, where data always flows from a source to a sink. A filter is
both source and sink for data, possibly with different data types. For integration with ROS, the library provides
a number of subscribers and publishers which act as sources or sinks of the data flow.

\par

Generally, the pipeline processing is executed by nested calls to receive and
send functions. The library is thread-safe and exception-safe, but you are
expected to handle your own exceptions in your callbacks. Exceptions which
propagate through the library will abort processing for the message that caused
the exception, and if not caught eventually by a preceding filter in the
pipeline, terminate the program.

\par

You can implement your own filter logic with fkie_message_filters::UserFilter and
fkie_message_filters::SimpleUserFilter.
